CRASTER'S KEEP
Craster pushes Jon Snow into his Keep, where the men of the Night's Watch have gathered.
CRASTER: Out. All of you.
The bastard's been meddling where he shouldn't. (kicks Jon) I want you and your men gone. And you'll make this right.
JEOR: Wait outside.
JON: Lord Commander --
JEOR: Now!

OUTSIDE
SAM: Lord Commander.
JEOR: Leave us. (Sam leaves) What did you do?
JON: Followed him. He took the baby into the woods - the newborn.
JEOR: And what business is that of yours?
JON: You don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys -- you know.
JEOR: The wildlings serve crueler gods than you and I. Those boys are his offerings.
JON: Offerings? He's murdering his own children! He's a monster!
JEOR: Many times that monster's been the difference between life and death of our rangers. Your uncle among them. We have other wars to fight out there! Like it or not, we need men like Craster.
JON: I saw it. I saw... something take that child.
JEOR: Whatever it was. I dare say you'll see it again. Now, ready my horse. We leave at dawn. (gives Jon Longclaw) Don't lose it again.
In the morning
Gilly exits the Keep. Sam follows her.
SAM: Gilly.
GILLY: You're leaving.
SAM: I wanted to give you something. Belonged to my mother.
GILLY: I can't take it.
SAM: Please. I want you to. My mother used it for sewing. She let me sit with her in a chamber while she sewed and read to her. Father put a stop to it when he found out. It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the wall.
GILLY: You... you shouldn't give it away.
SAM: I'm not giving it away - I'm giving it to you. Keep it safe for me, till I come back.
Gilly takes it and rushes off. Sam smiles and leaves.
