My name is Grey Worm. I come from the Summer "Ills."
Isles.
Summer Isles.
Summer Isles.
I am from an islandcalled Naath.
When they took you?
"When did they take me?"
I was five years old.
You remember your home?
I remember when theyrowed us away from shore.
How white the beaches were.
How tall the trees.
And I remembermy village burning.
Smoke rising into the sky.
Do you remember your home?
Unsullied.
Always Unsullied.
Before Unsullied, nothing.
That's not true.
Perhaps one day you willreturn to the Summer Isles.
I don't want return.
Kill the masters.
Kill the masters.
How are the lessons coming?
Very well, Your Grace.
Missandei is teachergood, my queen.
You'll have to continue later.
It's time.
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
Mhysa! Mhysa!
Remind me, Ser Jorah,
how many children did the GreatMasters nail to mileposts?
163, Khaleesi.
Yes, that was it.
Your Grace, may I have a word?
The city is yours.
All these people,they're your subjects now.
Sometimes it is betterto answer injustice
with mercy.
I will answer injusticewith justice.
What the hell was that?
That was me knockingyour ass to the dirt
with your own hand.
You're a rare talent.
When you're fightingcripples, anyway.
You learned to fightlike a good little boy.
I'll bet that thrust through the MadKing's back was pretty as a picture.
You want to fight prettyor you want to win?
You talk to my brother this way?
All the time.
He got used to it.
Do you think he did it?
No.
Oh, he hatedthe little twat, sure.
But who didn't?
And poison's not his style.
Or murder, for that matter.
You want to know for sure,why don't you ask him?
You haven't beento see him yet, eh?
We're done for today.
Your brother ever tell youhow I came into his service?
You stood for him in his trialby combat at the Eyrie.
Aye.
But only whenLady Arryn demanded
the trial take place that day.
You were his first choice.
He named you for his champion
because he knew you would ride dayand night to come fight for him.
You gonna fight for him now?
To tell you the truth,this isn't so bad.
Four walls. A pot to piss in.
I was chained to a wooden post
covered in my ownshit for months.
Is that supposedto make me feel better?
Maybe a bit.
I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
It's complicated, yes.
- So how is our sister?- How do you think?
Her son died in her arms.
Her son?
Don't.
You know what's coming?
My trial for regicide.Yes, I know.
I know the whole bloodycountry thinks I'm guilty.
I know that oneof my three judges
has wished me dead moretimes than I can count.
And that judge is my father.
As for Cersei,
well, she's probablyworking on a way
to avoid a trial altogetherby having me killed.
Now that you mention it,she did ask.
So, should I turn aroundand close my eyes?
Depends.
Did you do it?
The Kingslayer brothers.
You like it? I like it.
You're really askingif I killed your son?
Are you really askingif I'd kill my brother?
How can I help you?
Well, you could set me free.
You know I can't.
Then there's reallynothing else to say.
What do you want me to do?Kill the guards?
Sneak you out of the cityin the back of a cart?
I'm the Lord Commanderof the Kingsguard.
Sorry, I'd forgotten.
I'd hate for you to dosomething inappropriate.
Inappropriate?
You're accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason.
Except I didn't do it.
Which is whywe're having a trial.
A trial.
If the killer threw himselfbefore the Iron Throne,
confessed to his crimes, and gaveirrefutable evidence of his guilt,
it wouldn't matter to Cersei.
She won't restuntil my head's on a spike.
Not just yours.
She's offering a knighthoodto whomever finds Sansa Stark.
Sansa couldn't have done this.
She had more reason thananyone in the Seven Kingdoms.
Do you think it's a coincidence shedisappeared the same night Joffrey died?
No, but...
Sansa's not a killer.
Not yet, anyway.
Where are you taking me?
I'm getting marriedto your Aunt Lysa.
She's waiting for usat the Eyrie.
You'll be safe there.
Did you kill Joffrey?
Did I kill Joffrey?
I've been in the Vale for weeks.
I know it was you.
And who helped mewith this conspiracy?
Well, there was Ser Dontos.
You used him to getme out of King's Landing,
but you would never trusthim to kill the king.
Why not? - Because you're too smartto trust a drunk.
Then perhaps it wasyour husband.
No.
How do you know?
I just do.
You're right.
He wasn't involvedin Joffrey's death.
But you were.
Do you remember that lovelynecklace Dontos gave you?
I don't suppose you noticedthat a stone was missing
after the feast.
The poison.
I don't understand.
The Lannisters gave youwealth, power.
Joffrey made youthe Lord of Harrenhal.
A man with no motiveis a man no one suspects.
Always keep your foes confused.
If they don't know whoyou are or what you want,
they can't knowwhat you plan to do next.
I don't believe you.
If they catch you, they'llput your head on a spike
just like my father's.
You'd risk thatjust to confuse them?
So many men,they risk so little.
They spend their livesavoiding danger.
And then they die.
I'd risk everythingto get what I want.
And what do you want?
Everything.
My friendship with theLannisters was productive.
But Joffrey,
a vicious boy witha crown on his head,
is not a reliable ally.
And who could trusta friend like that?
Who could trust you?
I don't want friends like me.
My new friends are predictable.
Very reasonable people.
As for what happened to Joffrey,
well, that was something my newfriends wanted very badly.
Nothing like a thoughtful gift
to make a new friendshipgrow strong.
I can't believe you're going.
Leaving me alone herewith these people.
The time has come, my dear.
There's nothingmore tedious than a trial.
Except perhaps these gardens.
If I have to take onemore leisurely stroll
through these gardens, I'llfling myself from the cliffs.
Have you been to see Tommen yet?
No.
Have they even agreedto the match?
No one tells me anything.
I wasn't originally meant to marryyour grandfather Luthor, you know.
He was engaged to my sister,
your great-aunt Viola.
I was to be given tosome Targaryen or other.
Marrying a Targaryenwas all the rage back then.
But the momentI saw my intended,
with his twitchylittle ferret's face
and ludicrous silver hair,
I knew he wouldn't do.
So the evening
before Luthor wasto propose to my sister,
I got lost on my way backfrom my embroidery lesson
and happened upon his chamber.
- How absentminded of me.- Mm-hmm.
The following morning, Luthornever made it down the stairs
to propose to my sister 'causethe boy couldn't bloody walk.
And once he could,the only thing he wanted
was what I'd given himthe night before.
I was good.
I was very, very good.
You are even better.
But you need to act quickly.
Cersei may be vicious,but she's not stupid.
She'll turn the boy againstyou as soon as she can.
And by the time you'remarried, it'll be too late.
Luckily for you,the Queen Regent
is rather distractedat the moment,
mourning her dear departed boy.
Accusing her brotherof his murder,
which he didn't commit.
Well, he could have done.
He could have done,but he didn't.
- You don't know, Grandmother.- But I do know.
You don't think I'd let youmarry that beast, do you?
What? I don't understand.
Shh. Don't you worryyourself about all that.
You just dowhat needs to be done.
Bring it through!
And again.
Very nice. Good.
A lot of wildlings fightwith a weapon in each hand.
First thing you want to do
is disarm them to tryand even the odds.
Let's see what you can do.
Olly, you just watch for now.
I can fight.
Have you everheld a sword before?
I was the best archerin our hamlet.
I was!
I believe you.
We'll go huntingfor rabbits one day.
Right now, watch and learn.
You two.
Take it slow,try and disarm each other.
You know how to fight.
You could have goneeasier on him.
He wouldn't have learnedanything that way.
Lord Snow.
What do you think you're doing?
Grenn and I were helping them.
Grenn's a ranger.You're a steward.
Maybe you forgot that while youwere off with your wildling bitch,
but I didn't.
Someone has to train them.
And that someone isn't you.
Go find a chamber pot to empty.
Go on. Do it.
You traitor's bastard.
Give me an excuse.
Mormont's not hereto protect you now.
Get back to work.
Now!
I said now!
The bastard's well-liked.You're not.
You think I care if they like me?We're at war.
For now.
But you can't beacting commander forever.
There will be a choosing.
The old maesterwill insist on it.
You might reconsider
his request to marchon Craster's.
Let the mutineerstake care of Snow.
Or you might be takingorders from him
the rest of your life.
A bastard, eh?
Took you for highborn.
My father was highborn.
My mother wasn't.
Name's Locke.
Jon Snow.
You fight well.
What brought you up here?
A sense of duty.
I wanted to do my partfor the safety of the realm.
I was a game wardenin the Stormlands.
Fed a prized partridgeto my hungry kids.
I was stupid enoughto get caught.
Chose the Wallover losing my hand.
Figured I wouldn't have to suckup to any highborn cunts here.
Come on, get on with it.
What are youwaiting for? Summer?
Guess I was wrong.
You sent for me, Your Grace?
Your Grace.
How formal of you.
How many Kingsguards areposted outside Tommen's door?
Ser Boros is on duty tonight.
- Tomorrow I believe...-  So one?
You have one manguarding the future king?
I promise you Tommen's safe.
We're protecting him.
The way you protected Joffrey?
Why did Catelyn Starkset you free?
- What?- I've been wondering for months.
Ever since that great cow broughtyou back to the capital.
Why did she set you free?
You know why. She'd hoped I'dsend her daughters back to her.
She hoped or did you promise?
I swore by all the gods
that if her daughters werealive, I'd return them to her.
So you made a sacred vowto the enemy.
I wanted to get back to you.
Should I have told herto fuck off?
You didn't mean it, then?
You have no loyaltyto Catelyn Stark?
Catelyn Stark's dead.
So if I told you to leave thecapital right now and find Sansa,
if I told you to find thatmurderous little bitch
and bring me her head,
would you do it?
I know you went to see Tyrion.
That creaturewho murdered our son.
I had to see him.
I had to know for myself.
And?
He didn't do it, Cersei.
You've always pitied him.
Our poor little brother.
Abused by the world.
Despised by his fatherand sister.
He'd kill us all if he could.
I want four men at Tommen'sdoor day and night.
That will be all,Lord Commander.
Ser Pounce?
How did you get pastthe Kingsguard?
Kingsguard.
I don't think you'resupposed to be here.
Mother doesn't allow meto have visitors at night.
I'm not a visitor, Your Grace.
Word has itI'm to be your bride.
Did you know that peoplein arranged marriages
often never meetuntil their wedding day?
Before we decide to spendour lives together,
we ought to getto know one another.
Don't you think?
Yes.
But if my mother found out...
It can be our secret. Hmm?
If we're going to beman and wife,
we'll have a few secretsfrom her, I hope.
So, Your Grace...
Yes?
Tell me a secret.
Hello. Aren't youa proper fellow?
That's Ser Pounce.
Very handsome.
Joffrey didn't like him.
He threatened to skin him alive
and mix his innardsup in my food
so I wouldn't knowI was eating him.
That's very cruel.
You don't strike me as cruel.
No.
I don't think I am.
That's a relief.
Because you knowwhat happens when we marry?
We say our vows in frontof the high septon.
And after the ceremony,there's a feast.
When we marry, I become yours.
Forever.
It's getting late.
I should go.
May I come and visit you again?
All right, then.
Remember,
our little secret.
"Ser Jaime Lannister.
Knighted and named to theKingsguard in his 16th year.
At the sack of King's Landing,
murdered his king Aerys II.
Pardoned by Robert Baratheon.
Thereafter knownas the Kingslayer."
It's the duty of the LordCommander to fill those pages.
And there's still roomleft on mine.
Valyrian steel.
Mmm.
It's yours.
I can't accept this.
It was reforgedfrom Ned Stark's sword.
You'll use it to defendNed Stark's daughter.
You swore an oath to return theStark girls to their mother.
Lady Stark's dead.
Arya's probably dead, too,
but there's still a chance to findSansa and get her somewhere safe.
I've got something else for you.
I hope I gotyour measurements right.
I'll find her.
For Lady Catelyn.
And for you.
I almost forgot.
I have one more gift.
I don't need a squire.
Of course you do.
He'll slow me down.
My brother owes him a debt.He's not safe here.
You're keeping him from harm.It's chivalry.
I won't slow you down, ser...
my lady.
I promise I'll serve you well.
See? He's a good lad.You'll get along.
Compliments of Lord Tyrion.
His axe from the Blackwater.
What are youwaiting for, a kiss?
Ready the lady's horse.
They say the best swordshave names.
Any ideas?
Oathkeeper.
Good-bye, Brienne.
Come on, move.
I should neverhave taken her away.
- She wasn't safe here.- She's not safe out there.
I should have known.
You told us there werewildlings south of the Wall.
If they're raiding the smallervillages, Mole's Town could be next.
- Castle Black could be next.- I should go back for Gilly.
We have orders. No one'sto leave the castle.
I remember when you disobeyedorders and rode south to help Robb.
And I remember who came afterme and brought me home.
I know how hardit is, Sam, believe me.
When you told me about Brangoing beyond the Wall,
all I could think about was getting mystrength back so I could go and find him.
I wish I could have convincedhim to come back with me.
I tried. Really, I did.
How fast could they travel?
A crippled boy being pulledon a sledge by a simpleton?
I don't know.
They'd pass wildling villages.
They could try to findshelter at one of them.
The wildlingshave joined up with Mance.
Every village or shelteredplace will be deserted.
Except...
Craster's?
You think Branmight have found...
Snow.
I don't mean to interrupt.
Thorne wants to see you.
Your foray to Craster's Keep,
I'll sanction it.
But I won't orderanyone to go with you.
Volunteers only.
Thank you, Ser Alliser.
Ahem, brothers.
I'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep.
I'm going to capture the mutineersholed up there or kill them.
I'm asking for volunteersto come with me.
There's 60 miles of wildernessbetween here and Craster's
and Mance Rayder has an armybearing down on us,
but we have to do this.
Our survival may depend on
us getting to these mutineersbefore Mance does.
They know the Wall.They know our defenses.
If Mance learns whatthey know, we're lost.
But if that's not enough,
then consider this.
If the Night's Watchare truly brothers,
then Lord Commander Mormontwas our father.
He lived and died for the Watch
and he was betrayedby his own men.
Stabbed in the back by cowards.
He deserved far better.
All we can give him nowis justice.
Who will join me?
I can't let a recruitcome north of the Wall.
Then let me say my vows.
If it's a fight you're heading for,then you need men who know how.
Thank you, brothers.
No, don't.
Don't, please.
Please don't. Ow!
You're hurting me.
Karl Tanner from Gin Alley
drinking wine from the skull
of Jeor fucking Mormont.
Any command for us,Lord Commander?
What's that?
Fuck 'em till they're dead?
Did you hear that, boys?
Fuck 'em till they're dead.
Rast.
Go outside and feed the beast.
We should kill that thing.
You should shutyour fucking hole,
ugly little cunt.
You look likea fucking ballsack.
Ugly. Look at yourstupid cunt face.
I could piss in any gutterand soak five of you.
Know how much they paid me tokill a man in King's Landing?
Seven silvers.
They told me a man's name and thatman never saw daylight again.
None of them cocksuckersgot away from me.
Haven't lost a fightsince I was nine.
Maybe it's time.
What do you think, eh?
Maybe you're the man.
Eh, cunt?
I wouldn't stand a chance.
None of us would.
I was a fucking legendin Gin Alley.
A fucking legend!
I would take any knight...
any knight, any time.
Fucking cunts in steel plate.Fucking cowards.
- A gift for the gods.- A gift for the gods.
A gift for the gods.
What the fuck is that?
Craster's last child. A boy.
What am I supposedto do with him?
What did Craster do with 'em?
Kill 'em before they could growup and do the same to him?
All right.
Don't need anothermouth to feed.
- Hand him over.- He didn't kill them.
- He offered them.- To who?
To the gods.
The white walkers.
A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods.
A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods.
A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods.
Shut up!
So...
if it worked for him...
Let's give the walkerswhat they want.
Rast is headed that way.
Pink-eyed fuck.
You thirsty?
Fuck!
Hodor.
Do you hear that?
Is that a baby?
It's coming.
I'm going out there.
No, we need to stay together.
I'm going.
- Bran. Bran.- Hodor. Hodor.
- Hodor.- Bran, what happened?
Summer, he's hurt. They'vecaught him in a trap.
Who?
I didn't see, but theyhave my brother's wolf.
They have Ghost.
They're Night's Watch.
Look.
Jon might be here.
If Jon was here, why wouldthey put his wolf in a cage?
They might have been Night'sWatch once, not anymore.
We're not safe here.We need to go.
No.
Bran, we need to go now.
I'm not leaving without Summer.
Can you rememberwhere the cage was?
The east side of the keep.
If I'm not backsoon, we'll meet...
Hodor.
Hodor.
Hodor. Hodor.
Hodor.
If I was your size, I'd beking of the fucking world.
Help him up.
This is nice.
Fine leather.
You're no wildling.
Important. Highborn.
Who are you?
You see, where I come from,
a commoner like me slapsa little lord like you,
I'd lose my right hand.
But we're a long wayfrom home, aren't we?
And the two of you,
fancy-looking folksnorth of the Wall
creeping through the woods.
Isn't that a bit odd?
I like your curly hair.
My mom had curls like that.
Beautiful brown curls.
Why'd you drag a crippledboy all the way up here?
See you haven't playedthis game before.
A highborn hostage,
that's valuable.
But three of them,
that's a lot of mouths to feed.
- What the fuck's wrong with him?- Come here.
No, please.
Please.Please, let me help him.
- Who are you?- Please.
- Who are you?- I'm Brandon Stark!
I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.
It's Jon Snow's brother.
It's Meera. It's Meera.I'm right here.
And I thought this was gonnabe another boring day.
I'm right here.
